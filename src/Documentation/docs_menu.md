## Database Functionality

This react application is stores and manages all user data using firebase. The following database functionalities have been implemented in the code: 

- Read.js reads the data from the database and returns an array of objects. 
- Write_slots.js writes new slots to database
- DeleteSlots.js is used to delete a slot in the database. It takes slotId as a parameter and then deletes that slot.
