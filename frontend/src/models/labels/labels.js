    "LED": "Provides a stable and bright light source to illuminate the setup. Its output is used for generating uniform and controlled lighting conditions.",
    "Field Iris": "Limits the illuminated area on the target and reduces stray light. It is used to adjust the field of view for optimal contrast.",
    "Field Lens": "Focuses the light into the condenser, ensuring even and efficient illumination across the field.",
    "Aperture Iris": "Regulates the angular range of the light reaching the target, affecting resolution and contrast.",
    "Condenser Lens": "Directs and condenses light from the LED onto the target, ensuring bright and even illumination.",
    "Target": "Serves as the primary object in the optical system, generating diffraction patterns or images for study.",
    "Objective Lens": "Magnifies the target and collects light to focus it onto the Fourier or image plane.",
    "Beamsplitter": "Directs part of the light beam to an alternate path for simultaneous observation or measurement.",
    "Viewing Screen": "Displays the final image or diffraction pattern for direct visualization.",
    "Tube Lens": "Projects the image from the objective to the viewing screen or camera while maintaining image quality.",
    "Camera": "Records images or diffraction patterns for analysis and documentation."
